This repository contains my studies on implementing EIC beam effects in simulation.

Folder Pythia8 contains my implementation of EIC beam effects in Pythia8 using that programs native tools. It is envisioned that such code could be used to cross check 'afterburner' beam effects code as well as serve as an easy way for analyzers using Pythia8 to simulate the proper EIC beam conditions.
